# mustang-databrowser

The MUSTANG Databrowser is a web application that provides a means of plotting and viewing MUSTANG seismic data quality metrics through the
use of selector tools.  MUSTANG returns statistical information on the quality and character of seismic measurements captured in the IRIS
data archive.  The databrowser lets the users view this information in the form of x,y point plots, box plots, and probability density plots.

This project space is being used for the development of the next phase of the MUSTANG Databrowser, so none of the contents here are should
 be assumed to in any working state, nor are these contents supported by IRIS staff for external use.
