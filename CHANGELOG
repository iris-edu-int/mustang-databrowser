2018.269: 1.1.0 (2.1.0)
         - 'channel set' option added for PDF and trace plots. 
         - 'scale by channel set' option added for metric timeseries and trace plots. 
           This option scales the y-axis of all 3 plots identically.
         - network boxplot channel list now includes all available channels in the network.
         - 'plot next' and 'plot previous' buttons for network boxplots iterate over channels
         - 'plot next' and 'plot previous' buttons do not proceed to the next network when they
           exhaust the station list; instead they start start over at the beginning/end of the 
           station list (except when a virtual network is selected).
         - improved trace plotting
         - improved error messages
