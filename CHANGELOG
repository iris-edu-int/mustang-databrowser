2021.227: 1.6.0 
	 - addition of ts_availability metrics for PH5 data
         - bug fix for virutal network selection
2020.170: 1.5.0 (2.5.0)
         - addition of new MUSTANG metrics: sample_rate_channel, sample_rate_resp,
           max_range
2020.036: 1.4.1 (2.4.1)
         - fixes for new fdsnws/station webservice output
         - bug fix, station labels now appear correctly for scaled network boxplots
2020.013: 1.4.0 (2.4.0)
         - dropdown network/station selection boxes now include stations in the PH5 archive
         - gap duration plot vs date now disregards hours,minutes,seconds and plots the 
           time at 00:00:00. All values for each date line up at same x-axis mark.
         - added gap count vs date plot to the gap duration plot view.
         - minor bug fix, gap duration plots now work for restricted data
         - added plot option to spectrogram plots to use fixed scale -200,-50 dB for color
           scale limits. This had previously been default; default is now 5th,95th percentile
           of PSD power values (same as the spectrogram web service).
         - added color palette options to spectrogram plots.
2019.232: 1.3.0 (2.3.0)
         - added ?G? channels
         - added histogram to Gap Duration Plots 
         - the data URL link will not display for plots that do not have url links available
         - fixed bug in error display and other minor bug fixes
2019.144: 1.2.0 (2.2.0)
         - added Gap Duration Plots
         - modified error display to simplify output
2018.332: 1.1.1 (2.1.1)
         - added Google Analytics tracking bug to index.html
2018.269: 1.1.0 (2.1.0)
         - 'channel set' option added for PDF and trace plots. 
         - 'scale by channel set' option added for metric timeseries and trace plots. 
           This option scales the y-axis of all 3 plots identically.
         - network boxplot channel list now includes all available channels in the network.
         - 'plot next' and 'plot previous' buttons for network boxplots iterate over channels
         - 'plot next' and 'plot previous' buttons do not proceed to the next network when they
           exhaust the station list; instead they start start over at the beginning/end of the 
           station list (except when a virtual network is selected).
         - improved trace plotting
         - improved error messages
         - other minor bug fixes
2018.114:
         - fixed bug in multiple metrics timeseries plots
2018.113:
         - added noise-mode-timeseries plots
         - added 'scale by sensitivity' option to boxplots for sample_* metrics
2018.108:
         - added tsindex availability metrics
2017.306 - Release version 1.0.2 (2.0.2)
