                The <b>Time Span</b> fields specify dates used to query the database for metrics.
                Most plot types will also have a label specifying the range of data returned by the database.
  </p>
  <p>
		The <b>Network - Station - Location - Channel</b> selectors let users choose which channel
		they are interested in.  Lower order selectors are automatically updated to reflect
		what is availabile in each higher order selector. The network-station-location-channel
                options reflect the metadata timespans that exist in the IRIS database, and do not necessarily 
                indicate that data or metric values are present for the requested dates.
