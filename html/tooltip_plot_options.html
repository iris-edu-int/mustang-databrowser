    Currently available <b>Plot Type</b>s include:
    <dl>
      <dt>Metric Timeseries</dt>
      <dd>A simple timeseries plot of the values associated with the chosen metric.
         The "channel set" option for this metric will display three timeseries
         plots, one for each orientation in a channel set.</dd>
      <dt>Multiple Metric Timeseries</dt>
      <dd>A stacked set of plots displaying related metrics.</dd>
      <dt>Gap Duration Plots</dt>
      <dd>Four stacked plots: gap duration vs. date, gap duration vs. time of day, a histogram of gap durations, and number of gaps vs. date. <br>

      <dt>Network Boxplots</dt>
      <dd>Shows the statistical distribution of values for the chosen metric at
          each station in a network and can be thought of as a 'flattened' histogram of those values.
          The edges of each box are at the first and third quartiles while the
          median is represented as dark band.</dd>
      <dt>Station Boxplots</dt>
      <dd>Shows the statistical distribution of values for the chosen metric at
          Location-Channel combination within a station</dd>
      <dt>Seismic Trace</dt>
      <dd>Raw trace data from the IRIS DMC.</dd>
      <dt>PDF Plot</dt>
      <dd>Power Density Function plots for noise analysis</dd>
      <dt>PDF Noise Mode Timeseries Plot</dt>
      <dd>Daily PDF mode values for select frequencies/periods plotted as a function of time</dd>
      <dt>PDF Noise Mode Spectrogram Plot</dt>
      <dd>Daily PDF mode values plotted as a spectrogram.
