      <dt>Metric Timeseries</dt>
      <dd>A simple timeseries plot of the values associated with the chosen metric.
         The "channel set" option for this metric will display three timeseries
         plots, one for each orientation in a channel set.</dd>
      <dt>Multiple Metric Timeseries</dt>
      <dd>A stacked set of plots displaying related metrics.</dd>
      <dt>Network Boxplots</dt>
      <dd>Shows the statistical distribution of values for the chosen metric at
          each station in a network and can be thought of as a 'flattened' histogram of those values.
          The edges of each box are at the first and third quartiles while the
          median is represented as dark band.</dd>
      <dt>Station Boxplots</dt>
      <dd>Shows the statistical distribution of values for the chosen metric at
          Location-Channel combination within a station.</dd>
      <dt>Seismic Trace</dt>
      <dd>Raw trace data from the IRIS DMC.</dd>
      <dt>PDF Plot</dt>
      <dd>Power Density Function plots for noise analysis.</dd>
