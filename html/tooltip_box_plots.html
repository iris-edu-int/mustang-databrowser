<b>Box Plots</b> (as rendered by R) contain the following features:
  <dl>
    <dt>The Quartile Boxes</dt>
    <dd>
	The plot consists of two adjoining boxes that extend out to the 25% and 75% confidence interval regions, respectively.  50% of all values in the sample population fall within the range of these two boxes, also known as the <i>Interquartile Range (IQR)</i>
    </dd>
    <dt>Median Line</dt>
    <dd>
	The Median Line lies where the two boxes join, indicating the 50% confidence mark where the most points in the sample population land.  This line is many times not in the center, being <i>skewed left</i> or <i>skewed right</i> within the two quartiles.
    </dd>
    <dt>Range 'Whiskers'</dt>
    <dd>
	Two lines run out from the quartile boxes, extending to the smallest non-outlier value and the largest non-outlier value.  The end points of the whiskers are determined by a <i>range</i> rule, which by default is a value 1.5 times the IQR value (Q3 - Q1) from the outer edge of the quartile box.
    </dd>
    <dt>Outlier Dots (Optional)</dt>
    <dd>
        If outliers are selected for the plot, then all other points that do not apply to the established 'range' of values are displayed as a dot or small circle to the extremes.  These values are atypical representations of the sample population as a whole, but can offer insights into anomalies.
